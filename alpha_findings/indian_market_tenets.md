# 🦅 The Alpha Hunter's Manifesto: Tenets for Generating Alpha in Investing

## 🏛️ Executive Summary: The "Regime First" Philosophy

The single biggest determinant of Alpha is **Market Regime**. Our exhaustive study proves that "one size fits all" strategies fail.
*   **Bull Markets are for Beta**: Most stocks rise; finding *extra* alpha is hard (Sharpe ~0.55).
*   **Bear Markets are for Alpha**: This is where fortunes are made. Buying quality capitulation (Strong Bear + Trend 0-20) generates **Sharpe 1.84+** and **15%+ returns** in 60 days.

**The Golden Rule:** *Do not ask "Is this a good stock?" Ask "Is this the right stock for the current Nifty Regime?"*

## 📜 The 5 Tenets of Indian Market Alpha

### Tenet 1: Supply Dry-Up > Panic Buying
*   **The Myth:** Buy when volume explodes (spikes).
*   **The Reality:** Volume Spikes often indicate unfinished capitulation or "trapped buyers."
*   **The Alpha:** The highest returns come from **Volume Drop** or **Volume Flat** states coupled with deep oversold conditions (Trend 0-20).
*   **Why:** This signals that **sellers are exhausted**. The selling pressure has dried up, leaving the stock ready to float higher on minimal buying.

### Tenet 2: The "Strong Bear" Reversion
*   **Data:** In a Strong Bear market (Nifty < 200DMA & falling), buying stocks with **Trend Score 0-20** ( Deeply Oversold) is the highest expectancy trade in the market.
*   **Stats:** **80% Win Rate**, **14.6% Avg Return** (60 days).
*   **Action:** When the market looks its worst, aggressively buy the leaders that have fallen the most.

### Tenet 3: Sector "Personalities" are Fixed
Sectors do not behave the same. You must trade them differently:
*   **The Cyclicals (Metals, Industrials):**
    *   *Strategy:* **Deep Value Reversion**. Buy only when crushed (Strong Bear, Trend 0-20).
    *   *Return:* **23.8%** (Metals), **13.2%** (Industrials).
    *   *Note:* Buying breakouts here is a trap.
*   **The Compounders (Banking, Consumer):**
    *   *Strategy:* **Dip Buying in Bull Markets**. Buy Trend 0-20 pullbacks ONLY when the broader market is in Strong Bull.
    *   *Sharpe:* **3.86** (Banking), **3.16** (Consumer).
    *   *Note:* Do not short these. Just wait for the dip.
*   **The Defensives (IT, Pharma):**
    *   *Strategy:* **Momentum Continuation**. These work best in **Mild Bear / Choppy** markets as safe havens. Buy Trend 80-100.

### Tenet 4: The 60-Day "Sweet Spot"
*   **Observation:** Alpha decays or reverses after ~60 days for most reversal setups.
*   **Action:** For "Deep Value" trades, set a **Time Stop**. If it hasn't worked in 60 days, it's a value trap. If it *has* worked, book profits as momentum fades. Do not marry mean-reversion trades.

### Tenet 5: "Recovery" is a Dangerous Regime
*   **Observation:** The "Recovery" phase (Golden Cross after a bear market) is surprisingly low alpha (Sharpe 0.72).
*   **Why:** Volatility is high, false starts are common, and "dumb money" chases late.
*   **Action:** Be cautious. The easy money was made in the "Strong Bear" phase. Wait for "Mild Bull" confirmation.

## ⚠️ The "Alpha Traps" (What to Avoid)

1.  **Buying Breakouts (Trend 80-100) in Strong Bear Markets**: Low win rate. Most breakouts fail.
2.  **Buying "Volume Spikes" in Downtrends**: Usually implies more downside. Wait for the volume to dry up (Drop/Flat).
3.  **Shorting Consumer/Banking in Bull Markets**: They rarely crash; they just consolidate. You will bleed theta/carry costs.
4.  **Holding "Reversion" Trades > 90 Days**: If it turns into a long-term hold, verify fundamentals. The technical edge is gone.

## ✅ Implementation Checklist

**Before Every Trade:**

1.  **Check Regime:** Is Nifty > 200 DMA? (Bull/Bear check).
2.  **Check Sector:** Is this a Cyclical (Metal/Ind) or Compounder (Bank/FMCG)?
3.  **Apply Rule:**
    *   *If Cyclical + Bear Market:* Look for **Trend < 20**.
    *   *If Compounder + Bull Market:* Look for **Trend < 20**.
    *   *If Defensive + Choppy Market:* Look for **Trend > 80**.
4.  **Check Volume:** Is Volume **< Average** (Drop/Flat)? -> **GO.**
5.  **Set Exit:** **60 Days** or **Trend > 40** (for reversions).
