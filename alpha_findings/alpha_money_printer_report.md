## 🧠 The Core Philosophy (The "Why")

1.  **The Bull Market Trap:** Surprisingly, buying deep dips (Trend 0-20) in a Strong Bull market yields **-0.21% Returns**. *Do not buy junk on dips in a bull market.*
2.  **The Bear Market Miracle:** When Nifty < 200DMA, the "Lazy River" setup prints **15.75% avg returns** with **-9.04% avg pain**. This is the highest alpha regime.
3.  **Sector Personality:** Defense and Auto stocks in a Bear Market crash harder and bounce higher (**24% & 14% returns**) than defensive sectors.

## ⚙️ The "Money Printer" Algorithm

### Step 1: The Regime Gate (Weekly Check)
*   **Is Nifty 50 < 200 Day Moving Average?**
    *   **YES:** ✅ Activate "Bear Hunter" Mode (Aggressive Alpha).
    *   **NO:** ❌ Activate "Bull Rider" Mode (Passive Beta).

### Step 2: The "Bear Hunter" Setup (The 15% Trade)
*Target: 15-24% Return | 80-90% Win Rate | 60 Days*

1.  **Regime:** Strong Bear (Nifty < 200DMA).
2.  **Trend Score:** **0 to 20** (Deeply Oversold).
3.  **Volume State:** **Flat (-2 to +2)** or **Drop (<-2)**. *Avoid Spikes!*
4.  **Priority Sectors (The Snipers):**
    *   **🚀 Defense:** 24.3% Return | 85% Win Rate
    *   **🏚️ Realty:** 12.4% Return | 78% Win Rate
    *   **🚗 Auto:** 14.8% Return | 81% Win Rate
    *   **🏭 Industrials:** 13.2% Return | 96% Win Rate (!)
5.  **Action:** **BUY.**

### Step 3: The "Bull Rider" Setup (The Safe Trade)
*Target: 5-7% Return | Low Stress*

1.  **Regime:** Mild/Strong Bull.
2.  **Setup:** **Trend 80-100 (Breakouts)** with **Flat Volume**.
    *   *Note:* Oversold (0-20) buying FAILED in our backtest (-0.2% return). Only buy momentum in Bull markets.
3.  **Priority Sectors:**
    *   **🏦 Banking:** 3.1% Return | 62% Win Rate (Steady compounder).
    *   **🏗️ Metals:** 7.2% Return | 62% Win Rate.
4.  **Action:** **BUY Breakouts.**

## 🛡️ The "Sleep Well" Execution Rules

**Rule 1: The 12% Hard Stop**
*   **Data:** The average winning trade in our best setup only suffers **-9.04% Pain (MAE)**.
*   **Law:** If a trade hits **-12%**, it is statistically broken. Kill it.

**Rule 2: The 60-Day Time Stop**
*   **Data:** Returns plateau after Day 60.
*   **Law:** If it hasn't moved in 60 days, sell it. Dead money is expensive (Time Cost).
