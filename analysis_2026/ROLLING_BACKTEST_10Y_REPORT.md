## 🏆 The "Forever Soldier" Found

Across 10 years of chaos, one soldier stood tall:

**The Defensive Compounder (Consumer + Pharma)**
- **Consumer:** Best sector in 6 winning windows
- **Pharma:** Best sector in 5 winning windows
- **Consistency:** These sectors protect in crashes and participate in rallies.

## 💡 The "Wealth Formula"

Based on 10 years of data, here is the formula for wealth:

1. **Expect 9% per 6 months** (Not 20%).
2. **Reinvest profits** (Compound effect).
3. **9% compounded twice a year = 19.6% per year.**
4. **19.6% returns = 6x Money in 10 Years.**

### The Trap vs The Path

| Strategy | Target | Win Rate | Outcome |
|:---------|:-------|:---------|:--------|
| **The Gambler** | 20% in 6mo | 18% | Likely bust in bear markets |
| **The Soldier** | 9% in 6mo | **80%** | **6x Wealth in 10 Years** |

## ⚖️ Final Recommendation

**Stop chasing the 20% unicorn.**
The market only gives it 18% of the time.

**Deploy the "Consistently Boring" strategy:**
1. Buy mild bull dips in **Consumer & Pharma**.
2. Rotate to **Metals/Auto** only in Strong Bull.
3. Accept 9% returns.
4. Let compounding do the heavy lifting.

*The Soldier doesn't scream. He just marches.*
