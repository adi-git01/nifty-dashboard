# Portfolio Health Check & Alpha Audit
**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Market Regime:** 🐂 **Mild Bull** (Nifty 50 is in an uptrend but consolidating)
**Strategy:** Trend Following with Selective Dip Buying

---

## 🎯 Executive Verdict
Your portfolio is largely positioned for a **Trend Following** strategy, which aligns well with the current "Mild Bull" regime. Most of your heavyweights (Axis, ICICI, L&T) are in strong uptrends (Trend > 70).

**Actionable Signals:**
1.  **🟢 BUY DIP Candidates:** **MARINE**, **MAXHEALTH**. These are quality stocks in a defined pullback (Trend ~20) with Flat Volume. This is the classic "Bull Market Dip" setup.
2.  **🟡 HOLD:** The majority of your portfolio. Stocks like **HCLTECH, TITAN (proxy), SENORES** are riding the Trend 60-90 zone. Let winners run.
3.  **⚪ ETF Core:** Gold, NV20, and Alpha Low Vol (ALPL30) provide good ballast.

## 📝 Recommendations based on Alpha Tenets

### 1. The "Marine" & "MaxHealth" Opportunity
Your analysis flagged **Marine Electricals** and **Max Healthcare** as hitting the "Trend 20 + Flat Vol" criteria.
*   **Tenet:** "Dip Buying in Bull Markets".
*   **Action:** If you have spare cash, these are your best risk-adjusted adds right now.

### 2. Don't Chose Weakness Yet
Stocks like **KPRMILL** (Trend 45) and **COFORGE** (Trend 35) are in "No Man's Land".
*   **Rule:** Wait for them to hit Trend < 25 (Oversold) OR Trend > 60 (Momentum). Do not average down at Trend 40.

### 3. Let Winners Run (But Watch L&T)
**L&T** and **Axis Bank** are at Trend 90.
*   **Rule:** In "Mild Bull", breakouts often stick. But if Nifty drops below MA50, these high-flyers will correct fastest. Keep a trailing stop.

### 4. Sector Exposure
You have good exposure to **Capital Goods** (L&T, Cummins, Amber) and **Banks** (Axis, Federal, ICICI).
*   **Gap:** You are light on **Pharma/Defensives** (only Apollo/Max). If the market turns "Choppy", consider adding to Pharma.
