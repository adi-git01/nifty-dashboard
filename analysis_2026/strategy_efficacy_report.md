## Analysis & Insights

### ✅ Bullish Divergence (The Swing King)
- **Insight**: This is our most reliable **short-term** signal (10-20 days). It correctly identifies oversold bottoms where momentum is shifting before price.
- **Action**: Use Green Dots on the Multi-Factor chart to enter swing trades. Target 10-15 day holding periods.

### ✅ Golden Cross (The Investor's Friend)
- **Insight**: While it lags in the short term (negative 10d return), it is a powerful confirmation of a major trend change.
- **Action**: When a Gold Star appears, it's safe to build larger, long-term positions. Do not check P&L daily; give it 3-6 months.

### ⚠️ Momentum & Volume Spikes
- **Insight**: These are "noisy". While they confirm existing trends, entries based solely on them (without divergence or trend structure) have ~50/50 odds.
- **Action**: Use these as filters, not triggers. Only buy Momentum spikes if verified by a Trend Score > 70.

### 📉 Caution
- **Volume Spikes**: Often mark local tops if not accompanied by price breakout.
- **Divergences**: Lose predictive power after 30 days. Don't hold a "divergence trade" for 3 months expecting it to work forever.
