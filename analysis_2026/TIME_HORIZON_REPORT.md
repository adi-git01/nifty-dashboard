## 💡 The "Time-Horizon" Rule

### 1. Short Term (3-6 Months): **Use V1 (Original)**
- **Why:** In short bursts, selectivity matters most. V1 (10 stocks) picks the hottest sectors (e.g., Metals recently) and rides them.
- **V2 Lag:** Diversification (20 stocks) dilutes short-term winners.

### 2. Medium Term (1-3 Years): **Use V2 (Core)**
- **Why:** Over 1-3 years, you face sector rotations. V2's diversification catches multiple waves (e.g., Pharma -> Defence -> IT).
- **V1 Risk:** If V1 is in the wrong sector for 6 months, it drags down the 3-year return.

### 3. Long Term (5 Years): **Use V1 (Uncapped) or V2**
- **V1 Uncapped:** Wins by letting massive winners run (e.g., 5-baggers). But it's volatile.
- **V2:** A close second (+76% vs +80%) but with much smoother sleep-at-night variance.
