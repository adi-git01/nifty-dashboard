### 📊 Performance Matrix (By Index)

| Strategy | Nifty 50 | **Nifty Next 50** | Midcap 150 | Smallcap 250 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deep Value (Trend 0-25)** | **+4.44%** | **+4.58%** | +3.09% | +2.26% |
| **Momentum (Score 7.5-10)** | +0.89% | +1.28% | **+1.66%** | +0.98% |
| **The "Trap" (Trend 50-75)** | +0.01% | +0.12% | 0.00% | **-1.80%** |

**Insights:**
1.  **Smallcaps are Dangerous**: Bottom fishing in Smallcaps (+2.26%) is LESS profitable than Large Caps (+4.5%). *Reason: "Cheap" smallcaps often stay cheap or go bust.*
2.  **Momentum is Weak**: Even in Midcaps (the best place for momentum), it only yields +1.66%. It is currently not the primary driver of returns.
3.  **Avoid the Middle**: Trend 50-75 is a "Yield Trap", especially in Smallcaps (-1.8%).

### 🏭 Best Sectors for Alpha
Where should you apply the "Deep Value" strategy?

1.  **Technology**: **+4.69%** (Tech stocks mean-revert aggressively).
2.  **Healthcare**: **+4.66%** (Pharma is defensive and resilient).
3.  **Financial Services**: **+3.44%**.

## Final Recommendation
Your Dashboard's "Alpha" is currently found in **Reversals**, not Breakouts.

**The Golden Filter:**
1.  **Index:** Choose **Nifty 50** or **Next 50** (Safety + Bounce).
2.  **Sector:** Prefer **Tech** or **Pharma**.
3.  **Signal:** **Trend Score < 25** (or Momentum < 2.5).

*Ignore simple Momentum (Score 10) for now. The market regime favors value.*
