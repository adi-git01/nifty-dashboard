## 🚀 The "Hidden Gem" Strategy
Stop chasing breakouts. Start hunting for "Smart Accumulation".

### The Formula
1.  **Filter**: **Trend Score 0-25** (Deeply Oversold).
2.  **Trigger**: **Volume Score Jump (+1 to +3)**.
    *   *Meaning*: The stock is beaten down, but institutions are quietly stepping in (Moderate Volume Increase).
3.  **Hold Time**: **60 Days**.

### Expected Returns (60 Days)
| Index | Return | Alpha vs Baseline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nifty Next 50** | **+5.87%** | ⭐ **Best Risk/Reward** |
| **Smallcap 250** | **+5.37%** | 🚀 **Unlocked!** (Baseline was +2% without Vol Trigger) |
| **Nifty 50** | **+5.30%** | Reliable Anchor |

## 🎯 Where to Hunt (Best Sectors)
Apply the above formula primarily in these sectors:

1.  **Healthcare / Pharma**: **+8.35%** (The "Crown Jewel").
2.  **Communication Services**: **+8.08%**.
3.  **Energy**: **+6.51%**.
4.  **Technology**: **+5.86%**.

*Avoid*: Financial Services (+3.09%) and Consumer Cyclical (+2.86%). They are sluggish.

## ⚠️ What to Avoid (The "Traps")
1.  **Panic Volume (Jump > 3)**: If volume explodes (>3 jump), returns drop to +2.8%. This is capitulation, not accumulation. Wait.
2.  **The Middle (Trend 50-75)**: This zone is dead money across all indices.
3.  **Naked Momentum**: buying High Momentum (Score 10) blindly yields <1.5%.

## Execution Checklist
- [ ] Screen for **Trend Score < 25**.
- [ ] Check **Volume Score**: Has it increased by 1-3 points in the last week?
- [ ] Verify **Sector**: Is it Pharma, Tech, or Next 50?
- [ ] **Buy**.
- [ ] Set **Target**: +8% (or 60 days).
