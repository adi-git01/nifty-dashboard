## The Shocking Discovery

### What DOESN'T Predict Winners?

| Factor | Mega Winner Avg | Loser Avg | Verdict |
|:-------|:----------------|:----------|:--------|
| **Trend Score** | 80.0 | 80.5 | **SAME** (Not a filter!) |
| **Volume Ratio** | 1.02 | 1.04 | **SAME** |
| **Price from 52w High** | -19% | -16% | **SAME** |

> **Insight:** Trend Score alone does NOT separate winners from losers. Both groups had high trend scores (~80).

## The TRUE DNA of Winners (The 3 Alpha Signals)

### Signal 1: RELATIVE STRENGTH vs Nifty

| Group | 3-Month RS vs Nifty |
|:------|:--------------------|
| **Mega Winners** | **+4.3%** |
| Winners | +3.9% |
| Losers | +0.6% |

### Signal 2: HIGH VOLATILITY (The Beta Bet)

| Group | Annualized Volatility |

| **Mega Winners** | **38.5%** |

|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| % From 52w High | **-19%** | -16% |

> **Insight:** Mega-winners were bought on a **pullback** (19% below peak) but in a **strong uptrend** (73% above low).
> **Rule:** Buy when stock is **10-25% below 52w high** but **50%+ above 52w low**.

| Strong Bear | 79 (13%) | 8 (2%) | **9.9:1** |

> **Insight:** The BEST risk-adjusted regime is **Strong Bear** (9.9:1 win ratio). Buying dips in bear markets has the best asymmetry.

## THE DNA-3 STRATEGY (The Alpha Formula)

To beat Nifty by 2-3% CAGR:

1. **Filter 1 (Relative Strength):** 3-Month Return > Nifty + 3%.
2. **Filter 2 (Volatility):** Annualized Volatility > 35%.
3. **Filter 3 (Pullback in Uptrend):** Price 10-25% below 52w High AND 50%+ above 52w Low.
4. **Sector Focus:** Industrials, Metals, IT, Auto.
5. **Regime Boost:** INCREASE allocation in Strong Bear (highest Win:Loss).

### Exit Rules
- **Stop Loss:** -15% (Hard floor, non-negotiable).
- **Target:** None (Let winners run with trailing stop).
- **Trailing Stop:** Activate at +10%, trail by -10%.

## The Final Verdict

**Luck is NOT the answer.**

The DNA shows that winners share **3 specific, measurable characteristics** at entry:
1. Outperforming the market (RS > 3%).
2. High volatility (Beta players).
3. Buying pullbacks in uptrends.

**2-3% Alpha is achievable with discipline.**
