## 💡 Why v2 Won the War

### 1. Trailing Stops Caught Big Moves
- In 5 years, big trends emerge (e.g., PSU Bank Rally, Defense Rally).
- v1 sold early at +15%.
- v2 trailed stops and captured **+40%, +60%, +100% moves**.

### 2. Diversification Reduced Pain
- v2's 20-stock portfolio smoothed out sector crashes (like IT in 2022).
- Lower drawdown (-14.7%) meant faster recovery compounding.

### 3. More "Shots on Goal"
- With 20 slots, v2 didn't miss out on smaller sector rallies that v1 ignored.
