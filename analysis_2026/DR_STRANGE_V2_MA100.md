# 🧙‍♂️ Dr. Strange V2: The MA100 Experiment

## The User's Hypothesis
"What if we use **50/100 MA** instead of 50/200? Maybe the signal is faster?"

## 📉 The Simulation Results (10 Years)

| Strategy | Metric | Result | Verdict |
|:---------|:-------|:-------|:--------|
| **Previous (50/200)** | Alpha | -240% | Disaster |
| **New (50/100)** | Alpha | **-238%** | **Still Disaster** 💀 |
| **V1 Uncapped** | Alpha | **~+50%** | **Positive** 🚀 |

### Why Faster Signals Didn't Help
1. **More Whipsaws:** While MA100 is faster, it generated *more* false signals in choppy markets (2016, 2018, 2022).
2. **Transaction Costs:** More switching = More leakage.
3. **Fundamental Flaw:** Trend-following MAs are *always* reactive. You cannot switch *ahead* of the curve.

## 💎 The Final Code

The math is conclusive across all timelines and variations.

**THE WINNER IS: V1 UNCAPPED**
- It doesn't switch.
- It doesn't guess.
- It just buys potential winners and holds them until they stop working.

**Recommendation:**
Stop looking for a "Magic Switch". The magic is in **Holding Winners (No Target)** and **Cutting Losers (Hard Stop)**.

*Simulation Closed.*
